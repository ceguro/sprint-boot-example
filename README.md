# Docker with PostgreSQL Project

This project is an example of how to configure and run a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container for use in a Spring Boot application.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose (optional, if you wish to use it)

## Database Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file contains the necessary configuration to spin up a PostgreSQL database in a container. Make sure to adjust the environment variables for the username and password according to your needs.

Usage in the Application
Now that you have the PostgreSQL database in a Docker container, you can use it in your Spring Boot application. Make sure to adjust the database configuration in application.properties or application.yml to match the values you set in the docker-compose.yml file.
